***Description:***
A general use dungeons and dragons app for both dungeon masters and players. Will contain a map interface with player and creature tokens which on hover will give quick stats and on press will give stat block. and inititive tracker built in aswell. 

***Goals:*** I would like to make it completly free so that unlike dnd beyond or roll 20 you simply have full access to all you need in one space without having to open a million tabs.
